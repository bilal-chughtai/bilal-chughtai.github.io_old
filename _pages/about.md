Welcome! I am currently a Foundation Scientific Software Engineer at the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk), which is based in Exeter, though I am based remotely in London for the time being.

# Mathematics

From 2017 to 2021, I was a student at [Trinity Hall](https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), graduating with a BA and MMath degree in Mathematics. In my final two years, after briefly dabbling in pure maths, I took almost exclusively theoretical physics courses. My Part III Essay was entitled "The Search for CMB B-mode Polarisation from Inflationary Gravitational Waves" and supervised by Dr Blake Sherwin. It explored an exciting current area of research attempting to understand extremely early universe physics through a present day measurable polarisation pattern in the cosmic microwave background. It can be found [here](/files/PartIIIEssay.pdf).

# Experience

As an undergraduate, I was lucky enough to work at
* [DAMTP](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/), as a summer student working on [PyRoss](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross), a new numerical python library offering an integrated platform for inference, forecasts and both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions in structured epidemiological models.
* [Metaswitch Networks](https://www.metaswitch.com/), as a software engineering intern working on improvements to a Google Cloud based business intelligence platform.
* [Cambridge Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/), as an exam marker.

I was involved with several societies, notably committee roles on
* [Trinity Hall JCR](http://www.jcr.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/)
* [The Student Run Computing Facility](https://www.srcf.net/)
* [Cambridge University Powerlifting Club](https://www.cuplc.co.uk/)

My full CV can be found [here](/files/CV.pdf).

# Tutoring

I am an experienced (200+ hours) private tutor in mathematics. In the past I've tutored for GCSE, A level, IB, various university admissions tests including the MAT and STEP, and at University level. I've also given mock interviews for Oxbridge. Feel free to contact me via email if interested.

# Miscellaneous
